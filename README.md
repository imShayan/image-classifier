1) Basic implementation of deep neural network which has 3 hidden layers on MNIST dataset(consist of 28x28 images of hand written digits between 0-9).




2)using the keras tensorflow API simple image classifier can be wriiten in few lines of code.
Model predict makes prediction of accuracy upto .0973 of hand written digit.
this is a new line i haved right now .
